# Custom CSS Library

The Custom CSS Library is a collection of CSS classes inspired by Bootstrap. These classes provide predefined styling for common layout and spacing needs, allowing developers to quickly and easily apply consistent styles to their projects. For example, classes like ps-sm-23 to ps-sm-30 provide padding-left values ranging from 14rem to 21rem, respectively. By incorporating this library into your project, you can streamline development and save valuable time by leveraging these ready-made styles alongside Bootstrap.
